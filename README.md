> DeadLine is a work menagement aplication made to help you prioritize your tasks

## About project
Deadline is an web aplication which allows you to add tasks with specified due date and then keep track of how much time there is still left for you to finish them. The element distinguishing DeadLine from other work menagement applications available on the market is the focus on graphic representation of the remaining time and preventing information chaos.
Although DeadLine is (for now) based on localStorage, so it is not possible to pass data to the server, you can still use it and store all your tasks in the device you are working on.

## Inspiration
The project was created due to small amount of apps that help us visualize how much time do we still have to acomplish goals, finish work projects, or even do homework. The main concept was based on limiting the information to answer one question - "which task should I focus on now?"
